# Car-Preference
------------------

This is an analysis of the kind of cars people prefer to buy. The dataset includes features like year of make, type of fuel, transmission etc. which decides the
selling price of the car. Random Forest Classification algorithm has been used to properly classify the data and I have also shown the most important feature in the 
dataset using matplotlib.
